# Military Time - converter

  An App I made to practice physics animations on ReactJS. The input is in a 12-hour format, and the output is in a 24-hour format. The input time changes the color scheme (Day / Night)

### Warnings
* THIS APP USES MIN(), MAX() CSS FUNCTIONS! THIS MIGHT NOT WORK IN YOUR BROWSER!!
